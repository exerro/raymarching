Experimental raymarching.

This is heavily inspired by [Sebastian Lague's Ray Marching video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp5WWtMoeKg) on YouTube.

## 2D

`2d/` contains 2D experimental code just to illustrate the concept behind the rendering. It uses [Love2D](love2d.org).

## 3D

`3d/` contains 3D rendering code to use ray-marching to draw a 3D scene using OpenGL.
